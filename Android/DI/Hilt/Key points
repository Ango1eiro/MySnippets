• @Inject: Use in class constructors to inject code you own, such as the data 
mappers.
• @Provides: Use in modules to inject code you don’t own, like any library instance.
• @Binds: Use in modules to inject interface implementations when you don’t need 
initialization code. You’ll see an example later.
